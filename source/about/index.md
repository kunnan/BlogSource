Hi:  
I am Zhang, currently an undergraduate at the University of Glasgow.
# Fields of interest:  

- Compiler Technology
- Mobile Security
- Reverse Engineering
- Anything Darwin/XNU related

# Ongoing/Planned Projects
**I apparently lack the knowledge to fully understand everything here at merely 21. Consider it a TODO list for at least three more years starting from 2018**

- Some kind of Mach-O wrapper for Unicorn Engine
- [Homura](https://github.com/Naville/Homura) An ongoing effort to replace LLVM's naive Interpreter and use it as a base for all kinds of cool stuff like cross-platform VM-Based Protection, iOS HotPatch and whatnot. Private repo at the moment.
- ``Blanc``, a toolkit to help defeat my binary obfuscator [Hikari](https://github.com/HikariObfuscator/Hikari), only aims for the open-source version though.
- ``Noir``, like ``Blanc``, but aims to defeat ``Homura``.

# Study Roadmap:
- Deeper look into the Dragon Book
- Symbolic Execution
- Hardware-Level stuffz
- Kernel/OS/Exploiting Techniques

I'm new to all those so errors and the alike do surely present in my blog. If you found one of them or simply willing to discuss something with me, send me an email at ``YWRtaW5AbWF5dXl1LmlvCg==`` (Base64 Encoded for obvious reasons).

Enjoy your stay here!
